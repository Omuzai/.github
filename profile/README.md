_Writing software for the good of humanity._

## About

We're just a couple of blokes who can write code and who want to make the world
better in some small way. One day, this profile might have a bunch of useful
opensource stuff, but in the meantime all the fun stuff is hidden inside private
repositories. As you might expect!
